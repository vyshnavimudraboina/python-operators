#Python Operators
'''1.Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations on numbers.

Operator| Meaning| Example
"+"| Addition| "5 + 3 = 8"
"-"| Subtraction| "5 - 3 = 2"
"*"| Multiplication| "5 * 3 = 15"
"/"| Division| "10 / 2 = 5.0"
"//"| Floor Division| "10 // 3 = 3"
"%"| Modulus (Remainder)| "10 % 3 = 1"
"**"| Exponent (Power)| "2 ** 3 = 8"
'''

#Python Example

a = 10
b = 3
print("Addition:", a + b)
print("Subtraction:", a - b)
print("Multiplication:", a * b)
print("Division:", a / b)
print("Floor Division:", a // b)
print("Modulus:", a % b)
print("Exponent:", a ** b)

'''Output

Addition: 13
Subtraction: 7
Multiplication: 30
Division: 3.3333333333333335
Floor Division: 3
Modulus: 1
Exponent: 1000 '''

#2.Assignment Operators

'''Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables and update their values.

Operator| Meaning| Example
"="| Assign| "a = 10"
"+="| Add and assign| "a += 5"
"-="| Subtract and assign| "a -= 5"
"*="| Multiply and assign| "a *= 5"
"/="| Divide and assign| "a /= 5"
"//="| Floor divide and assign| "a //= 5"
"%="| Modulus and assign| "a %= 5"
"*="| Exponent and assign| "a *= 2"

example'''

a = 10

a += 5
print("After += :", a)

a -= 3
print("After -= :", a)

a *= 2
print("After *= :", a)

a /= 4
print("After /= :", a)

a //= 2
print("After //= :", a)

a %= 3
print("After %= :", a)

a **= 2
print("After **= :", a)

#output;

'''After += : 15
After -= : 12
After *= : 24
After /= : 6.0
After //= : 3.0
After %= : 0.0
After **= : 0.0

3.Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used to compare two values. They always return a Boolean value: True or False.

Operator| Meaning| Example
"=="| Equal to| "5 == 5"
"!="| Not equal to| "5 != 3"
">"| Greater than| "8 > 5"
"<"| Less than| "3 < 7"
">="| Greater than or equal to| "8 >= 8"
"<="| Less than or equal to| "5 <= 7"

example'''

a= 10
b = 5
print("Equal to:", a == b)
print("Not equal to:", a != b)
print("Greater than:", a > b)
print("Less than:", a < b)
print("Greater than or equal to:", a >= b)
print("Less than or equal to:", a <= b)

'''output;

Equal to: False
Not equal to: True
Greater than: True
Less than: False
Greater than or equal to: True
Less than or equal to: False
Practice Questions

4.Membership Operators

Membership operators are used to check whether a value exists in a sequence such as a string, list, tuple, or set. They return a Boolean value: True or False.

Operator| Meaning| Example
"in"| Returns "True" if the value exists in the sequence| "'a' in "apple""
"not in"| Returns "True" if the value does not exist in the sequence| "'z' not in "apple""


example'''

colors = ["red", "green", "blue"]
print("red" in colors)
print("yellow" in colors)
print("green" not in colors)
print("black" not in colors)

'''output;

True
False
False
True

5.Identity Operators

Identity operators are used to check whether two variables refer to the same object in memory. They return a Boolean value: True or False.

Operator| Meaning| Example
"is"| Returns "True" if both variables refer to the same object| "a is b"
"is not"| Returns "True" if both variables refer to different objects| "a is not b" 

example'''

a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a
c = [1, 2, 3]

print("a is b:", a is b)
print("a is c:", a is c)
print("a == c:", a == c)
print("a is not c:", a is not c)

'''output;

a is b: True
a is c: False
a == c: True
a is not c: True

6.Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to combine two or more conditions. They return a Boolean value: True or False.
Operator

Example'''
#and
'''Returns True if both conditions are True
a > 5 and b < 10
or
Returns True if at least one condition is True
a > 5 or b < 10
not
Reverses the result (True becomes False and vice versa)'''

'''7.Bitwise Operators
Bitwise operators perform operations on the binary (bits) representation of integers.
Operator


&
Bitwise AND
5 & 3
`
`
Bitwise OR
^
Bitwise XOR
5 ^ 3
~
Bitwise NOT
~5
<<
Left Shift
5 << 1
>>
Right Shift
5 >> 1

example '''

a = 5
b = 3
print("AND:", a & b)
print("OR:", a | b)
print("XOR:", a ^ b)
print("NOT:", ~a)
print("Left Shift:", a << 1)
print("Right Shift:", a >> 1)

'''Output

AND: 1
OR: 7
XOR: 6
NOT: -6
Left Shift: 10
Right Shift: 2'''
